# Student Performance Risk Prediction

This repository contains a complete pipeline for predicting student academic risk (High/Medium/Low) using machine learning. The project helps schools and educators to identify students who need support early based on their background, study habits, social, and health factors.

Project Structure

- **Notebook.ipynb**
Jupyter notebook with all the data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **Presentaion.pptx**
Presentation explaining the project workflow, results, and impact for academic or stakeholder review.
- **Technecal_Report.pdf**
Full technical report detailing problem definition, data source, methods, results, and ethical discussion.
- **app.py**
Flask API for serving the trained student risk prediction model. It accepts student features and responds with a risk category in real-time.
- **student_model.pkl**
Pickled trained machine learning model (Support Vector Machine) used for prediction via the Flask API.


How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**

```
git clone https://github.com/medo469/student-performance-model.git
cd student-performance-model
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```
pip install flask numpy pickle
```

3. **Run the API:**

```
python app.py
```

    - The server will run on: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
    - To predict, send a POST request to `/predict` with `feature1` and `feature2` in the JSON body.
4. **Example request:**

```python
import requests

data = {'feature1': 7.2, 'feature2': 5.3}
resp = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict', json=data)
print(resp.json())
```


Features

- Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
- Automated preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and selection
- Ready-to-use web API for easy integration
- Presentation and report for documentation


Usage

This project is ideal for:

- School admin or teachers to target support for students at risk
- Data science learners interested in educational analytics
- Anyone wanting to deploy a ready ML model in Python
